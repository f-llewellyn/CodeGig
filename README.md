This project is heavily based upon the "Build a Node.js App With Sequelize" series from Traversy Media on youtube (https://youtu.be/bOHysWYMZM0), however, I plan to add functionality and generally improve upon this project over time.

This is awfully insecure and I do not reccomend using this in a production environment without heavy modification.
