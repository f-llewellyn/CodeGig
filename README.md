> Simple Job find app for developers. This app usese Node, Express, Sequelize (mySQL) and Handlebars.

This project is heavily based upon the "Build a Node.js App With Sequelize" series from Traversy Media on youtube (https://youtu.be/bOHysWYMZM0), however, I plan to add functionality and generally improve upon this project over time.

This is awfully insecure and I do not reccomend using this in a production environment without heavy modification.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Serve on localhost:5000
npm start

# Dev server (dev)
npm run dev
```
